# Frontend Take-Home Challenge

Your task is to create a small web application that displays a list of training sessions. Clicking on a session takes
the user to a separate screen displaying details of the selected session.

We expect you to spend no more than 3 hours on the challenge.

The data is provided by a function that mimics an HTTP API. We provide you with a design for the detail screens of the
different sessions. We do not provide a design for the list, you can style it the way you see fit. The list should
provide minimal information on each session. The user should be able to mark certain rows as favorites. This should be
represented visually, and favorites should be sorted at the top of the list.

The task is too big to achieve in 3 hours if you want to do everything perfectly. We want to emphasise though that this
is not a competition on who can achieve the most under time pressure. It is about evaluating where you decide to
prioritise and invest more time and where you allow for suboptimal solutions. In that sense, we are interested in your
decision-making and not in how many lines of code you can write in a given period of time. Please do not feel pressured
by the time limit.

After you finish the challenge, we will have an in-depth discussion on your code. We will focus especially on the
approaches you took and the decisions you made along the way. In that sense, be prepared to answer questions on why you
did things in a certain way, where you think things could be improved and what potential next steps could be.

To get you started, we provide you with a `.zip` file that contains a basic project bootstrapped with `create-react-app`
. It includes TypeScript, but you are not required to use it. If you’d rather work in JavaScript, just suffix any files
you create with `.js/.jsx`. We also included the icons from the design as SVGs. You are free to add any additional
libraries of your liking. Be prepared though to answer questions on why a library you include is a good fit and what its
purpose is.

You should have received a link to a figma design for the details screen. If not, please contact us so that we can
provide it. You may need to create an account if you don’t have one yet. If you’d rather not do that, please let us
know, and we’ll find a way to provide you with the design another way.

If you have any questions or get stuck along the way, please do not hesitate to contact us. We wish you good luck and
hope you have fun solving the challenge!
